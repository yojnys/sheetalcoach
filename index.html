  <section id="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Sheetal Soni—an ICF-certified coach and senior HR leader with over 25 years of experience enabling individuals, leaders, and teams across diverse cultures and regions to unlock their full potential.</p>
    <p>My coaching style is intuitive, strengths-based, and non-directive. I hold space with deep listening, curiosity, and presence, creating a safe, reflective environment where insight and transformation can naturally unfold.</p>
    <p>With experience working across Asia, Europe, and North America, I bring a deep understanding of cross-cultural dynamics and global business environments.</p>
    <h3>I’ve coached:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Senior leaders and high-potential talent</li>
      <li>Professionals at crossroads</li>
      <li>Teens and young adults</li>
      <li>People facing life transitions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Core Beliefs:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You are whole, capable, and resourceful.</li>
      <li>Coaching is a space for insight—not instruction.</li>
      <li>Real change happens when reflection meets action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Coaching</h2>
    <p>Coaching is a powerful, forward-focused partnership that supports growth, clarity, and meaningful change—across all areas of life.</p>
    <p>It’s not about giving advice or fixing problems. Instead, coaching creates space for deeper self-awareness, clarity, and forward movement.</p>
    <p>As your coach, I’m here to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen deeply and without judgment</li>
      <li>Ask thought-provoking questions</li>
      <li>Help you uncover insights, patterns, and purpose</li>
      <li>Support you in taking intentional, aligned steps forward</li>
    </ul>
